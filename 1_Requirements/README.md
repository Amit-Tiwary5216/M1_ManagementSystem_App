# Requirements
  * The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. This mini project is easy to operate and understand by the users. This is built as an application.
# High level requirements
 * 1.) Proper Log-In system 
 * 2.) Validations
 * 3.) Easy to add, retrieve, modify and delete records.
# Low level requirements
 * Parking Management System is based on the concept of managing parking area record. There’s a login system available for this system, the user can freely use its feature. This mini project contains limited features, but the essential one. This is helpful for managing parking information by adding, updating, removing, viewing and searching for details.
 * The user can perform the CRUD operations to it. Here User can add Vehicle detail in the program and it’s not time-consuming. This System makes easy to store records of ech vehicle. The system creates an external file to store the user’s data permanently.
# SWOT
 * Strength :- Saves time and energy, Easy to implement, Free and easy access to the App.
 * Weakness :- Single point of failure, Jamming RF frequency interface.
 * Opportunities :- Can be implemented in any parking system, Save in nature (reduce pollution).
 * Threats :- To be acceptable by the driver culture, There are similar application developed in world wide.
# 4W's and 1H ?
 * Now days in many public places such as malls, multiplex system, hospitals, offices, market areas there is a crucial problem of vehicle parking.
 * The vehicle parking area has many lanes/slots for car parking. So to park a vehicle one has to look for all the lanes. Moreover this involves a lot of manual labour and investment.
 * Instead of vehicle caught in towing the vehicle can park on safe and security with low cost.
 * Parking control system has been generated in such a way that it is filled with many secure devices such as, parking control gates, toll gates, time and attendance machine, car counting system etc. These features are hereby very necessary nowadays to secure your car and also to evaluate the fee structure for every vehicles entry and exit
 * The objective of this project is to build a Vehicle Parking management system that enables the time management and control of vehicles using number plate recognition. The system that will track the entry and exit of cars, maintain a listing of cars within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not.
