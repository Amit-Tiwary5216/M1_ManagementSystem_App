# Test Plan
- Testing is a process to show the correctness of the program. Testing is needed to show completeness, it improve the quality of the software and to provide the maintenance aid. Some testing standards are therefore necessary reduce the testing costs and operation time. Testing software extends throughout the coding phase and it represents the ultimate review of configurations, design and coding. Based on the way the software reacts to these testing, we can decide whether the configuration that has been built is study or not. All components of an application are tested, as the failure to do so many results in a series of bugs after the software is put to use.
- Test Cases are good in revealing the presence of faults. Successful in implementation of test cases implies that there are no error in program. Test cases should be minimum as they are expensive in case of money & efforts. Primary objectives of test cases are to ensure that if there is an error or fault in program it is exercise by the test cases. An ideal test case set is one that succeeds only if there are no errors in the program. One possible ideal set of test case is one that includes all possible I/P to the program and is called exhaustive testing. A test case is good if it detect in undiscovered error in program.
